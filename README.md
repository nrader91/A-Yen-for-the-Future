# A-Yen-for-the-Future
Time-Series/Linear Regression Forecasting

Will run predictive simulations of the Yen vs US Dollar.  

Using historical data and various models we will answer questions regarding exchange rate futures.

# Time-Series

## Conclusion 1: Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?

The major conclusion formed with this data is that the Yen will become riskier using past data.  With increased volatility there is a possibility of the Yen going up you just need to time your trade correctly.  Depending on how risky you would like to trade there is oppurtunity to make profit. Personally I would need to do further analysis before trading.  


## Conclusion 2: Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?

GARCH model shows an increase in volatility - This means the Yen is expected to increase in risk. 


## Conclusion 3: Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?

I think these models have value in showing predictions.  However, you would need to use all of the models combined and do more research on top of that before making a trade.  The low P-values are a bit concerning. These models would be a good supplemental tool.


# Linear Regression

## Conclusion 1: Does this model perform better or worse on out-of-sample data compared to in-sample data?

Using the RMSE values for both (out-of-sample) and (in-sample) we can conclude this model had better performance in the (out-of-sample) data.  The RMSE value was lower therefore the data is much more concentrated in this example.
